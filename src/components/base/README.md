# Base Components

Reusable, generic UI components that can be used throughout the application.

## Components

- **BaseButton**: Standardized button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost)
- **BaseCard**: Container component with consistent styling
- **BaseInput**: Form input with validation states
- **BaseConfirmModal**: Reusable confirmation dialog

All base components use design tokens from the design system for consistent styling.
